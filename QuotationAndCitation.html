        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
            For 5 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
            The world's leading conservation organization,
            WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
            1.2 million members in the United States and
            close to 5 million globally.
        </blockquote> And I think she is right.
